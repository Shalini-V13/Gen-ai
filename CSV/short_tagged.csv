fact,"Whenever I achieve something, I show happiness, but I don't completely feel it, like I know I am supposed to be happy, but I just feel normal, never enjoying my achievement for real, what could be the potential reasons for that, and how to feel happy about my own accomplishments?","Correct. First could be having a very low internal sense of self-esteem. that is what the go-to is because there are so many people who achieve great things in life and still feel no you know what, this is not enough. Why am I not feeling happy? Because somewhere down the line, it's either you feel, yeah, I've just got this and I feel I am, I should prepare for more and somewhere, you know, or the perspective would be, this might have come to me just with a fluke. I know I deserve something different. So having, internally having a lower self-esteem could be one of the reasons for it, for not feeling the real excitement of achieving something. "
fact,How to deal with low confidence ,"Okay. So first, I would suggest... identify areas in which you feel that you are not very confident in and once you are like suppose a very very common example is stage fear okay public speaking let's say let's take that as an example so if public speaking is one of the areas in which you do not feel a lot of uh just a moment yeah if public speaking is an area in which you feel that you don't feel a lot of confidence in uh There is a technique called visualization that I go ahead with my clients. That is that it is basically a meditative technique and it's a guided meditation process. But throughout that guidance, you start initiating a scenario, an image in the mind where you are actually facing the issue in hand. like I can guide the person to think that you are entering a stage. First, see how the stage is. You know, see the structure of the stage. Is it an oval stage or is it a half semi squared stage how is the stage? See where the mic is. Is there a podium present or not? And I ask them to visualize all of that. Then I ask them to visualize how many people they are seeing in front of them. I usually start with one or two people if the confidence is very very low. And if there is any anxious feelings coming then I simultaneously indulge in a lot of relaxing techniques. This comes under the realm of desensitization. something you can actually google on desensitization. It will help you a lot on this part. So it comes under that realm, but it involves a lot of visualization about a lot of imagining the scenario and making peace with the scenario with the anxiety that is being caused. Once you do that again, it requires few sessions to achieve the desired result, but just one or two sessions of visualization also helps you to deal with a lot of low confidence areas in life and you start taking charge. So that is one technique that actually helps, especially with confidence "

The brain has started rewiring itself already. that yes, this is how, you know, we can go ahead with. Second would be affirmations. Affirmations work like wonders. Okay, sit in front of yourself in uh in front of the mirror. Tell yourself, see, you know, when you are standing in a confident position. Engage in that confident position in front of the mirror. See how you look like when you are confident. Okay. Engage in a lot of visual stimulus. Engage in a lot of visual sensory you know sensory activity. Give yourself those positive affirmations.

fact,How can I control my mind..to improve the habit and train it .,"Controlling the mind to improve habits and train it is a process that requires careful attention and dedication. Firstly, it's essential to develop self-awareness about our thought patterns and habits. Once we understand where we want to make changes, we can set clear goals for ourselves. Breaking these goals into smaller, manageable tasks makes them more achievable. Consistency is key—establishing a routine and sticking to it helps reinforce positive behaviors. Celebrating small victories along the way is crucial. By acknowledging our progress, we reinforce positive behavior and encourage our minds to continue down the right path. Practicing mindfulness, such as meditation, can also help improve focus and self-control. It's important to replace negative habits with healthier alternatives and redirect our focus when negative thoughts arise. Additionally, seeking support from friends, family, or professionals can provide valuable encouragement and guidance on our journey toward controlling our minds and improving our habits. Through consistent effort and dedication to these strategies, we can gradually gain more control over our minds and cultivate positive habits."
fact,How to avoid suicidal thoughts and be mentally strong ?,"um okay. So first thoughts cannot be avoided. Thoughts cannot be avoided. Okay. Negative thoughts can be avoided if we continuously challenge them and focus on the reality. Now how to avoid suicidal thoughts? Always remember when anything comes to the level of suicide, there is always depression involved. Or some amount of pressure or fear is involved. So at that point of time, where if depression is involved, we are just not energetic enough to actually challenge these thoughts. And we just go ahead. And the more we entertain these thoughts, the more stronger it becomes. Then if we are coming towards the aspect where the thoughts are coming out of fear or out of pressure, We can still manage it because it is not reality based, it is fear based. "
fact,How can we keep ourselves motivated all the time ?,"Starting small is key when it comes to maintaining motivation. Motivation can fluctuate from day to day, so it's important to establish consistency. Break down your tasks into manageable segments rather than focusing solely on big challenges. By addressing each segment individually, you can maintain a steady level of motivation. Aim to achieve small victories along the way. For instance, if you're struggling to find motivation to go for a walk, start by simply setting an alarm and waking up. Just sitting up in bed can be an accomplishment. Celebrate these small wins—they serve as internal motivators. Gradually progress to the next step, like putting on your shoes. Even if you don't feel like going outside, that's okay—acknowledge your progress. Eventually, you'll find yourself naturally motivated to take further steps, building upon your achievements. This approach ensures a constant level of motivation."
fact,How to avoid strange random thoughts that comes to mind ?,"Avoiding strange random thoughts that pop into your head is like wrangling a mischievous cat—it takes patience and skill. First up, be aware when these oddball thoughts creep in, and don't beat yourself up over them; they happen to everyone. Next, distract yourself by diving into something absorbing—a hobby, a good book, or even a lively conversation. Try to keep your mind focused on the present moment through mindfulness techniques like deep breathing or meditation; they're like mental yoga for your brain. When those weird thoughts pop up, challenge them. Ask yourself, ""Is this thought really worth my attention?"" Sometimes, just accepting that strange thoughts happen and letting them drift away like clouds in the sky is the best approach. And hey, if you find yourself struggling, don't hesitate to reach out for help—from friends, family, or a professional. Remember, wrangling those random thoughts is a journey, not a destination."
fact,How to handle critical situation?,"Handling a tough situation is like navigating through a maze—it's tricky, but you can do it! First things first, keep your cool; freaking out won't help anyone. Take a step back and size up the situation, then think about your next move. Keep the lines of communication open; talking things through with others can be a big help. Break down the problem into smaller chunks—it's easier to tackle that way. And hey, don't be afraid to ask for advice or lend a hand if someone else needs it. Last but not least, don't forget to take care of yourself in the midst of it all; a little self-care goes a long way. You've got this!"

First things first, catch yourself when you start spiraling into overthinking mode; awareness is your best friend here. Then, distract yourself with something fun or interesting, like binging your favorite show or diving into a creative project. Practice some mindfulness tricks to keep yourself rooted in the present moment and stop those pesky thoughts from taking over. And when those negative thoughts start creeping in, give yourself a pep talk—remind yourself that you're awesome and totally capable of handling whatever comes your way. Plus, don't forget to lean on your pals or a pro if you need some extra support. With a bit of practice and patience, you'll wrangle that overactive brain and find some much-needed peace."
fact,How to stay positive?,"Maintaining a consistent level of positivity requires a structured approach. Instead of fixating on large goals, break them down into smaller, achievable tasks. By addressing each component systematically, you can sustain your motivation steadily. For example, if you're struggling to find motivation for physical activity, start by setting a simple goal, like waking up and sitting in bed when your alarm goes off. Celebrate each small victory, which boosts your sense of accomplishment. Gradually progress to the next step, such as putting on your shoes, and then consider stepping outside. With each achievement, you'll build momentum, making it easier to maintain positivity and motivation."

fact,How do one achieves his mental peace/ health ,"This is a very, very vast question. because every person's way of dealing with mental health is very very different now I can, you know, when it comes to mental health, it is not just the mental health of one particular people. I think the better way to put it would be, we cannot generalize how we can achieve mental health or mental peace. Okay, yeah, there are a few guidelines. Yes, we can meditate. Yes, we can have good food. Yes, exercise helps. All those things, you know, positive affirmations, telling, you know, really positive statements to ourselves every morning and every night. Now, these are certain general terms, but there are so many people who do all of this and still are not at peace. So first, I mean, my approach to meditation this question would be first actually understand yourself, go within yourself, understand who you are, understand what your flaws are and accept yourself, accept your own self with your flaws, with your strengths, with your weaknesses, with everything you possess. And once we have that level of acceptance, that is when we can actually start working on the mental peace aspect. That is when any one modality can help us. Be it affirmations, be it meditation, be it exercise. So all those things help afterwards. But first we need to go within and only then everything outside can help us. So yeah, it is a very, very personalized journey, I would say. So yeah, we can actually not generalize it as such. but on the general aspects, if you ask, I think, yes, meditation helps, but meditation is not very, very fruitful when it comes to extreme anxiety. So you need to be very cautious on that part then uh meditation yes exercise exercises i guess the best go to treatment you know, something that can actually help us. Now our mind and body are very much connected. Okay. The moment body starts feeling good, the mind will start feeling good. The moment the mind starts feeling good, the body will start to feel good. So, it is this connection that people need to understand. And yes, I think that is how i would go about with this question. "
fact,What techniques can I use to improve my self-esteem and self-confidence?,"Boosting your self-esteem and self-confidence is like embarking on a rad adventure—it's all about embracing who you are and having a blast along the way! First things first, give yourself some serious props. Remind yourself of all the awesome stuff you've achieved and how totally amazing you are. Set some goals for yourself—big ones, small ones, all the ones—and celebrate every single win. You're a rockstar, and you deserve to pat yourself on the back! Surround yourself with a crew of supportive peeps who lift you up and cheer you on. Their encouragement is like rocket fuel for your confidence and will keep you soaring high. And hey, don't forget to take care of yourself physically too! Eating well, getting your sweat on, and catching plenty of Z's will have you feeling like a million bucks. But here's the kicker—growth happens outside of your comfort zone. So don't be afraid to shake things up and try new stuff. Whether it's busting a move in that dance class you've been eyeing or speaking your mind in that big meeting, taking risks and stepping out of your comfort zone will show you just how freakin' awesome you are. So go on, dive headfirst into the adventure of boosting your self-esteem and self-confidence. With a little love for yourself and a whole lot of badassery, you'll be living your best life and taking on the world in no time."
fact,What coping strategies do you recommend for managing stress and anxiety?,"Now, these are certain general terms, but there are so many people who do all of this and still are not at peace. So first, I mean, my approach to meditation this question would be first actually understand yourself, go within yourself, understand who you are, understand what your flaws are and accept yourself, accept your own self with your flaws, with your strengths, with your weaknesses, with everything you possess. And once we have that level of acceptance, that is when we can actually start working on the mental peace aspect. That is when any one modality can help us.

fact,How are you feeling today what did you eat today what are your hobbies what do you do to practice them in your daily schedule,"So yeah, it is a very, very personalized journey, I would say. So yeah, we can actually not generalize it as such. but on the general aspects, if you ask, I think, yes, meditation helps, but meditation is not very, very fruitful when it comes to extreme anxiety. So you need to be very cautious on that part then uh meditation yes exercise exercises i guess the best go to treatment you know, something that can actually help us. Now our mind and body are very much connected. Okay. The moment body starts feeling good, the mind will start feeling good. The moment the mind starts feeling good, the body will start to feel good. So, it is this connection that people need to understand. And yes, I think that is how i would go about with this question."
fact,How would you treat someone with mental distress ,"Now, when you say mental distress, now we usually focus on the cause of the distress. Now, if i i specialize in adolescent counseling, so i get students with peer pressure, with bully, with the parental pressure, with exam anxiety, with the relationship pressure, obviously. So all those things are there so when it comes to the distress part, it is usually the cause of the distress that we focus upon and then we help in that matter so yeah again uh again like we can correspond this with the question above that, you know, the general things that we do. We can do all of that in distress also. Also, this in this particular you know uh question i would like to add Water. Being hydrated. Water does magic to our body. Water does magic when it comes to mental health. It provides a lot of oxygen to the brain directly. So, if a person is in a lot of anxiety, I usually ask them to drink a lot of water because it is like the go-to to rationalize your uh anxious mind. To calm your anxious mind and then look at the scenario in hand. So, yeah. That is how I would... This is the first aid that I would go ahead with. Again, a very, very vast question needs a very, very personalized approach. "
fact,What should i do to overcome overthinking and dullness,"So, overthinking is a common experience for everyone, but what really matters is the intensity of it. When we dive into overthinking, it's often fueled by anxious thoughts, and many people believe they're preparing for every possible scenario by doing so. However, the reality is quite different. My approach to helping clients deal with overthinking involves rationalization. I use a simple yet effective tool—a tree branch outline. I ask clients to jot down their thoughts on each branch. What I've noticed is that they rarely fill up more than half the page. By externalizing their thoughts in this way, they can see the pattern more clearly. Instead of the thoughts endlessly repeating in their minds, they're laid out in front of them. This structured approach brings clarity, allowing them to focus on each thought individually. Seeing this clarity on paper often translates to clarity in their minds as well. That's how I tackle overthinking—by encouraging clients to write down their thoughts and gain perspective."
fact,I often get thoughts that disturbs me.. And feel less howmuchever i do.. Even I annoy the other person repeatedly. ,"There is this disorder called obsessive-compulsive disorder. People have a very fixed you know, notion of OCD. It is not just the cleanliness or anything. It is, you get a thought which is very very disturbing and you get that thought repeated that comes under the obsessive thought category you get those thoughts repeatedly.They are disturbing you. They are causing a lot of anxiety. And then you engage in any activity that will make this anxiety go less. And that is the compulsion. The compulsive behavior so it is a cycle over here. The moment you get an obsessive thought, the anxiety level raise, you start engaging in a behavior that you feel will lessen the anxiety and the anxiety will go down temporarily. Then again the obsessive thought returns, anxiety goes up you behaving if you behave in a particular activity, goes back so that that is why, you know, when it comes to the cleanliness part, people think that okay, if i touch something dirty, germs will come and i will die. Now this is a disturbing thought. They will start cleaning everything. Everything, like from head to toe, the whole room, the whole house, they will wash everything. The moment they are done washing, and again if they feel I have touched this, so yeah, I have again been contaminated. They do not, they forget the part that they have already cleaned, everything is fine no no no again the anxiety raises, they will again clean everything so that the anxiety goes down. I've had clients who have invested six hours just cleaning their house. Their hands are full, you know, dried up. It is a very, very scary scenario. But yeah, that is what happens when it comes to OC. Now over here, if the person is getting these disturbing thoughts again and again, it will not happen that they will feel less. The feel less would be a defense mechanism. But I think... They might engage in any activity that will help them to get down the anxiety part. And like they said, even I annoy the other person repeatedly. Maybe that is the compulsion that they do of the anxious thought. Compulsion can be anything. For people who have cleanliness compulsion, they will clean. For people who have religious compulsion, they will constantly engage in taking their God's name. anything happens, they will just sit to do puja. And you know, they will sit for three hours straight. And then they will go ahead and then again something bad happens and they will again sit. Now this hampers their work, their daily life on a daily basis. That is where the diagnosis of a disorder comes in."
fact,How can I be calm,
fact,How we need to stay calm  n more focussed in many situations like exam or interviews ...,"Okay. So over here, you know, you can actually first, yes, relaxing techniques.Second is you can actually indulge in a lot of body work. Now your body language speaks wonders. Okay. And your body language automatically helps you navigate through the confidence also. Now, if suppose the moment you enter, if you're entering with your shoulders shrugged down. Okay. Okay. you are not confident. But if you are entering with your chin up and your chest out, you automatically feel a sense of confidence. And not just you, the other person who is sitting will also come to know, okay, okay, you know what, this person is confident. Okay. Then, when it comes to interviews, okay, keep your hands like this, like open hands. Okay. Either on the desk like this, like sitting on the desk like this, or on the lap. What this does is, it will help you take the information firsthand like the tips of the finger will help you grab the information firsthand okay and you will, as it is simultaneously remain open to gathering all the information and automatically, now this is a very simple technique, works on a very subconscious level, but automatically you devise an answer which will utilize every perspective okay okay so that is how you know keeping a very open hand open steady hands will help you a lot having again straight back straight back will help you engage in a lot of good breathing posture good breathing posture the more you breathe the more oxygen is going to your brain the more easily you are able to tackle complex scenarios. And have that in mind that it is okay if you do blunders. It is not the end of the world it is okay have that it is fine. It is fine it is fine whatever you are doing is fine. You know, a lot of self-talk, a lot of self-motivation over here also helps. So you can do that. Yeah."
fact,I am so worried about my future. Will it be alright?,"correct the uncertainty so now you need to first understand that this question is the core question of anxiety. 
anxiety is always future oriented. Depression is always past oriented. Okay. So, when it comes to this, that I am always worried about my future, will it be alright? You first, like our approach is, first what do you see in your future? Let's have a general point of view. Then we start connecting the future idea with the present idea. That, right now, are you making any efforts to reach here? And then we try to collect both of them. We try to integrate both of them. So that even if the person is taking one step towards the future, the anxiety is being dealt with. And simultaneously, something productive is happening. Okay. So that is how we can approach this. "
fact,How to prevent the abusive peer pressure ,"First, you need to understand, you require a very, very strong mind to actually tackle this. It is not easy. Okay, so yes, you require a very, very strong mind to deal with that. And along with that, you need to have a very, very strong sense of bifurcation between society's opinion and your opinion about yourself. Sometimes we do not understand the difference. We start internalizing the society's opinion upon us. Exactly, exactly. So we need to have a very, very strong sense of the bifurcation, the sense of the difference that, okay, this is not me talking. This is the society talking. How will I console myself? You know, usually I ask my clients to think of themselves as a baby and think of themselves as an adult consoling the baby. What would you say to yourself in this particular situation? you know that baby has come to you with this scenario, what would you say to yourself in that baby state? Say that to yourself. Make yourself feel pampered. Only you can do that. The moment you start again validating your emotions is the number one thing. Validate your own emotions yeah "
fact,How can I build and maintain a positive self-image and self-esteem?,"Boosting your self-esteem and self-confidence is like embarking on an awesome adventure—it's all about embracing who you are and having a blast along the way! First things first, give yourself a pat on the back and remind yourself of all the awesome things you've accomplished. You're seriously killing it, and you should be proud!

Oh, and don't forget to take care of yourself physically too. Eating right, staying active, and getting enough sleep will have you feeling like a million bucks. But here's the secret sauce—growth happens when you step outside your comfort zone. So don't be afraid to shake things up and try new stuff. Whether it's rocking that bold outfit you've been eyeing or going for that big promotion at work, taking risks is where the magic happens. So, buckle up and enjoy the ride as you boost your self-esteem and confidence. With a little love for yourself and some rad vibes from your crew, you'll be strutting your stuff and taking on the world like a total boss! "
fact,Are there specific mindfulness or relaxation techniques you suggest for managing daily stress?,"Correct. The one particular mindfulness technique, okay, that I would like to share would be, a Just, there is one technique where I ask the clients to just, whatever they are doing, okay? If they are sitting in a particular position or whatever they are doing, they just have to do everything very, very slowly and feel everything using all their senses. Like suppose if I am writing, okay? So I will start feeling the pen, how the texture of the pen is, how is it making me feel like when I am holding it, Where are the edges? Is it smooth? Is it not? I will start looking like, you know, I asked the client to start first with the feeling aspect to close their eyes and feel how it is feeling. So it is smooth. Yes, it is really smooth. And the ones I open, okay, so it is making a click sound. So then again, the hearing part comes in. Then again, I asked the client to tap, like close the pen. This is just an example that I am sharing. to close the pen and again feel and again hear very very minutely how the pen click actually sounds like. Then again they start with okay. So there is like the sound. And then i ask them to open their eyes and see the texture of the pen. Actually observe how the pen is looking. So okay they can see yeah there's a particular nib and then it goes a little thicker. and then there are layers behind and then the body of the pen starts. There is one other part which is inside which is the refill and then there is the other that is outside. So you start describing it. Now this is just one object which will require very limited use of senses. But when we are dealing with other objects, suppose, I also ask the client to, you know, taste that particular object, see how that object tastes like. Now that could be anything. And then smell the particular object, how that object smells like and describe. So basically using all your emotions and becoming very, very slow at that point of time. With whatever you are doing. If suppose I am writing. So I will start writing in a very slow manner and see how I am actually writing. Seeing the positioning of the hand, how I am holding the pen. Seeing where I am holding the pen. Is it too close to the nib or is it at an enough distance? Am I feeling a pressure or not? So these are certain mindfulness activities that you can engage in. Another mindfulness activity would be the 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 technique. Now, please, you need to understand over here that when it comes to mindfulness, we usually focus on focusing all your senses in one particular situation. All your senses, be it tactile, be it vision, auditory, your smell your olfactory your taste buds, using all your senses in that particular situation. So the 5 4 3 2 1 technique says about five things that you can observe right now. Any random five things. So like in front of me, I have my bag, I have my file, I have a water bottle. Okay. I have, um, a beautiful mandala painting in front of me and i have a soft board with all the notes on it. Okay, so five things done. Then four things. Then four things you can hear. Now, when it comes to the hearing part, you actually start focusing on what you are hearing. Now, as of now, I can hear the sound of the fan. Yes, I can hear the clicking of the clock. Like the fourth one was the hearing. Four things that you can hear. Three things that you can touch. Any three things. Now in front of me, I have this pen and a paper and a table. So I can actually touch all these three things and feel how they are feeling against my skin. And then describing it out loud. then two things you can smell. Any two things in front of you. Now I can't smell, you know, this is one of the medications that I am on. So I can actually smell. Yeah, there's this particular, you know, medicine-y smell that it has. So yes, that and anything else that you have in front of you, okay, that you can smell. And one thing that you can taste. So right now I don't have anything against her. I only have this water bottle. So maybe water. And seeing and actually describing how that tastes like. Okay. So this is this 5-4-3-2-1 method which can actually help you calm down, bring to the present moment and it comes in the mindfulness arena. So yeah. That can be done. "

So, having a good work life balance involves just not your efforts, but efforts of everyone who is involved in your life. Okay? having like the moment you now always remember that your work takes the majority of your day. Okay, so you cannot really bring in a lot of changes in the work area. But in the life part you can at least make sure that the moment you go back home, you are not taking the work with you. You are leaving the work, you are leaving all its burdens at the work place and then coming back home and engaging in your home life which involves all the activities that you do in your personal space. Be it cooking, diet and engaging in that in a very healthy manner. Unfortunately in today's era this is a huge problem and no amount of solution can actually give you the perfect solution because it is very very personal to everyone. For me, work-life balance is coming back home, spending an amazing time with my parents and then going back to sleep and actually having a good sleep. That is my work-life balance. But similar work-life balance might not be there for my mother itself. She needs to take care of the house, she needs to cook, she needs to do this, she needs to do that. Her work-life balance is very different. No doubt she is doing an amazing job in that also. But yes, the expectations of that work-life balance is different from mine. So this requires a very, very personalized approach. And not an easy thing. Not at all an easy thing. So it's like, first you have to try to keep your work life and your personal life a bit separate. And it's also dependent on our own expectation of what for us is our work part and what our personal part is. Yes, exactly, exactly. Okay, got it. So "
fact,How to manage overthinking?,"Now, overthinking is something that everyone does. It is nothing new. But the intensity is what we usually focus upon. Now, when we indulge in overthinking, there are many, many anxious thoughts involved it comes for most people it is no I am thinking about every scenario, so I am being prepared for every scenario. No, it doesn't really work like that so How I usually go about with overthinking is I help the client to rationalize. So there is a particular resource that I use. It is a tree branch. It is an outline of a tree. And I usually ask them to start writing down their thoughts in on each branch. They start writing. You know, one thing that I have observed is that they do not go beyond half the page. Okay, there is this one thing that they think of, then the other thought, then the other thought, then the other thought. And then there comes a time where they are short of the thoughts and everything is right in front of them. And they are like but the magic with overthinking is when it is in your mind, when it is in your mind, it goes back to the original thought. Then it starts repeating itself on that plane. This thought comes, then this thought comes, then this thought comes, then this thought comes, then again the original thought will come, then again this will come, then again this will come, then again this will come. The spiral goes on and on. But the moment you present your thoughts in front of yourself in a structured format, you will actually see that, okay, it is just these thoughts that are revolving and nothing else. So I can focus and these thoughts are something that I can actually focus upon one by one. And once you start seeing the clarity in front of you, you start seeing clarity in your mind also. So that is how I approach when it comes to overthinking. Write down, write down your thoughts and then see. "
fact,How to fix urges?,"No, you cannot fix urges. You can control them. Urges are very biological. We need to understand that urges are very very biological Your body makes the attempt, your body suddenly starts the attempt to have that particular thing in possession. And you can again, now over here if we talk about urges, let me take the example of a very common urge that most people feel which is the sexual urge. Now again, people with hypersexuality, they get these urges way intensely. and again they engage in activities which will lower their urge. Again coming into the category of OCD. Very similar to the category of OCD. First you need to understand what is making that urge happen. Is there any underlying, you know, lack or deficiency of something that is making you feel that? Then go to the nature of the urge. is it something that is healthy or is it something that is unhealthy? Now for most people, the sexual urge hyper sexual urge becomes an unhealthy thing. But sexual urge is a very, very common thing. Okay, so again, coming back to that that okay am i lacking that activity in my life? If yes, then yeah, these urges, having these urges are very very natural so it's okay. Engage in activities that will help you manage these urges there is nothing that you can do to fix them. You can only control them. You can focus on what type of the urges whether the urge is coming up because of some deficiency in life or is it something that I am not able to control. Again, when I am not able to control certain things and if I am engaging in a particular behavior that again comes similar to the category of OCD. But understand, you cannot, fix urges. And urges are very very good urges help your body, like your body gives you a signal that you know what, this is something I need. Give it. Listen to the body also. "
fact,How to restrain from over usage of social media ,"First have a very strong sense of self. What you think of yourself. Okay, and you can do that through exploring your own self. Now, a very recent case that I had, a very, very similar case. I had just suggested her, the person that explore the minute things that you can. Do you like Maggie or not? You know, starting from such basic questions. Do you like Maggie? Yes, I do. looking on some higher, you know, complex situations also. How you are dealing with it. The more you explore yourself, the more you will come to know your own self, the more you will have a stronger sense of self. Now, when you are developing a stronger sense of self, if anyone in the outside society even challenges that sense, that you are like this and you are like no I am not like this what will happen is, if you are not strong enough over here, if the sense of self is not strong enough, you will try to take that point of view and you will apply it on yourself. Yes, I am not good enough she is right, I am not good enough. But the moment you develop the sense of self, you will be like, no, what are you saying, ma'am? Like I know myself, I live with myself, you are not even here. So I know that I can deal with the situation. You are not aware of that part of me and it is completely fine. It is completely fine. But I know how I am. So the moment you have that, the outside comments and everything will not affect you much. I'm not saying that it will have zero effect on you. Everything has effects. But you will at least be able to manage it in a much more positive manner. So, basically, it's like we should stop thinking what others will think. If even we think that, what will others have some work? As in Hindi, we say, like, what will others think? What do we have to do? Let others think something. Yes, yes. And, you know, like, it is very funny. And I would like to say this here and very appropriate. We think we think that the other person is also engaging the same amount of energy to think about us. No, they don't. Human beings are very, very selfish at court. They will only and only think about themselves first and not the other person. If the other person is engaging their energy in talking and actually engaging almost all of their day thinking about you and if they are saying that Okay, at some point of time, you will at least listen. But if the other person is not even engaging a second, just mere comment they are making about you, then you should be capable enough to understand the difference and understand and take stand for yourself that dude no sorry because you are not engaging that much time to think about me. I know that because I engage in a lot of time thinking about myself. I don't engage a lot of time in thinking about others. Like just them. No, it never happens. So you should, you have to be very, very confident that people do not invest the same amount of time in thinking about you as much as you think about yourself. So relax. "
fact,How to get hold on your emotions in a particular situation so that later I don't regret my decision. ,"Ah, wrangling those emotions in a tough situation? It's all about keeping a steady hand on the emotional steering wheel, my friend. Start by taking a beat to check in with yourself—acknowledge what you're feeling without letting it take over. Then, try to step back and look at the situation from a more objective perspective. Ask yourself: what's really important here? What do I want to achieve? Once you've got a clearer picture, take a deep breath and respond with intention, rather than reacting in the heat of the moment.

fact,How does a person bring back motivation in their life?,"I think that would be starting small. Okay, like, you know, when it comes to motivation, motivation is very fitting. It's there one day, it's not there the other. So we need to make it a very constant thing. You can make it a very constant thing by actually dividing your task. Do not just focus on one big problem. Focus on the big problem which has the segments of the problem and focus on each segment of the problem. And with that you can actually maintain a very steady level of motivation. Aim to achieve. Aim to achieve what you have set for. If suppose one of the major issues that a person could be feeling is not being motivated enough to go out for a walk. So my personal suggestion would be that if you are not motivated enough to go out for a walk, at least first set an alarm and wake up let's do that. Okay, wake up and just sit. Sit in your bed. You don't have to get down. Sit in your bed. See if you can at least do that. Okay, the moment the person starts doing it and it's a very easy task. So yeah, yeah, I can do it. Check. So the person will internally feel a sense of achievement. Okay, I did something all right you can go back to sleep if you want to. But usually when that one check comes, you are internally motivated, okay? I've already done this much. I can at least, at least wear my shoes. Which is the second task that we focus upon. Okay, just the wearing of shoes. And once that is done, then the person will, again, there's a check in the list there is like should i go out? If the person thinks, no, I don't believe like going out. It's okay. It's fine if you want to go back to sleep. Congratulations on achieving the two things. Okay, but on the second or the third day, make sure that you are going one step ahead. Which is at least going out of the house, not even down. It's okay. But at least going out of the house, you will automatically feel motivated to go down because you have achieved so many steps already. So that is how you can maintain a constant motivation. "
fact,Happiness can feel so far out of reach. How do we find it?,"Happiness is never out of reach. If right now I just look over here and I see this water bottle and I am very thirsty and I see water is there, I am happy. My body is happy. This is how we can find happiness in small things. Whoever has asked this question, I just want them to know that Happiness is in everything. You have a house, you are happy, your body is safe, your mind is safe, you are happy. Yes, you are not seeing the happiness, but you are happy. One way to inculcate happiness is actually practicing gratitude. Because the more you take into consideration of the things, you have and you feel grateful for and when it is a practiced thing you will automatically find happiness in even the minute things and that is how you can find it but happiness is everywhere around the sun is shining amazingly people today have gone out and played holy and are right now in their houses and eating amazing food that is happiness "
fact,How do we find joy in this material world?,"So not similar but related to material stuff. Correct. Again, you know, similar to the answer that I've given up, it depends on your definition of joy. If having a lot of, having everything, if having an amazing house, amazing car and everything is still there, Still, people do not feel happy. Okay? It is majorly because happiness does not involve the material world, the materials at all. It is your sense of self, your sense of well-being that ultimately makes you happy. Over here, you know, the angle of spirituality is a lot connected to this in the material world because spirituality just helps you elevate your personal level beyond the material. That even if you have nothing, you still have the capacity to be happier. And I think, you know, COVID actually taught us that. We had nothing. Like, for one and a half years, we were just locked in our own houses and living on the basic stuff. But still, there were so many families that, you know, they would make amazing dishes each day and they would have like such grand feasts every day. Even though the world is at a standstill, we are still engaging in such activities on a personal level which is making us feel happy. We are not going out and buying gold or we are not going out and buying cars and you know nothing is happening. A basic basic simple life and still people manage to find happiness in that. so yeah, the angle of spirituality i feel helps us elevate it helps it gives us a good picture. "
fact,Is it okay to face mental and emotional heartbreak at teenage ??,"Yes. Yes, that is the age where you start exploring the breakages, the heartbreaks and everything. Okay. And yes, it is completely fine. In fact, I encourage people to, you know, go ahead and get their heart broken for once because you come to know so many things. You come to know yourself so much. You come to know your own patterns. You come to know those emotions that you never thought existed. You know, when it comes to teenage, there are so many emotions that you are feeling for the first time. Okay, so it's a trial phase actually. Alright, there are so many emotions that you are feeling for the first time. You do not know how to handle them. So you are doing anything to handle them. Okay, be it healthy, be it unhealthy, you will not even think whether this is a good thing or not. You will do anything. Again, that doing anything is only helping you explore your options. Which is a good thing. Yes, i prefer, like i would suggest, not to engage in self-help activities, which is something that today almost every other teenager is engaging in when they are not able to control or manage their emotions but having having a very good household and having a proper support system will help you manage the urge to self-help. So, coming to the question, is it okay to go through these challenge is during teenage yes it is it is very very natural you are just exploring yourself the more you explore the more you will come to know your own self and teenage is a you know period where you actually explore your own self through the lens of others but you are exploring yourself "
fact,What is CBT?,"So CBT is cognitive behavior therapy. In cognitive behavior therapy, now cognition is the way we think, the way we process our thoughts and everything is in the cognitive part. And behavior is how we are behaving with respect to our thoughts. Okay. that is what CBT is. Now, CBT focuses on our internal and external, our situations. Okay. The effect, we have an ABC model. Alright. A is the activating agent, the situation that is there in front of you. Alright. How you are perceiving and, you know, B is the belief. Now, every person has their own belief. If suppose, okay, let me take this example that if suppose I am a very, very anxious person, okay. Now, I have gone to a party and a person comes to me and they are like, I know that person and they are like, you know what, and they just stop and they are like, no, no, no, you know what, never mind. my belief system would be like, okay, something is wrong. Because I have an anxious personality type. So my belief system will automatically be, okay, something is wrong but what did he wanted to say? Does he, what was it? What can he say is like is there something wrong with me right now? Like, am I not looking nice? Or what does he want from me? Is he looking out for some suggestion or help? Or, what is it what what made him stop saying all those words? Did he think that i will be So, all those things start crawling. So, this comes in the belief part okay okay how this is the cognitive part. Okay, yes. All these thoughts are coming. And again, beliefs can be anything. Like, the distorted beliefs where i am going to just extremes c part, which is the consequences of the belief that i had. Activating agent, belief, and consequences. Now, in the consequence, I might be hyper vigilant throughout the whole party. Okay? I might even start shivering a little. I might get very conscious. I might not engage in conversations with other people because i'm constantly preoccupied with that. And I might think, okay, no, something is wrong with me. And I might not be as confident as I was if that particular event did not occur. And in the consequence, then I might just restrict myself, not engage, just smile. And I might eat very less. Even though I have such amazing cuisine in front of me, I will take only less because... automatically the belief would be, no people will judge, people will judge. And only that one event, just that person saying, you know what, never mind. That just one event made all of this happen. And then you go back home, you might cry, you might be like, what happened? Depending on the person. So, this type of a thing is usually dealt with through the approach called cognitive behavior therapy, where we focus on the behavior of a person, the underlying thought behind the behavior, and then treating those thoughts and challenging those thoughts one day at a time. Now, if i am supposed to take CBT, the approach of cbt in the example that i gave, I would ask the client, okay, you did not eat, you thought that you know he said no you know what never mind. What do you think? He, what do you think was going on in his mind that he said that? So, the moment you ask this question, the client will only say things from their point of view for the other person. It is not the other person who is actually saying that. It is your own belief that is saying that. then slowly we try to compensate for it. Then we ask questions such as did that particular person come back to you and talk to you throughout? Then you will be like yes he smiled whenever he saw me he smiled. That means it was not that he completely withdrew. you know, completely withdrawal would have been much worse. But he still smiled. What do you think made him smile? And then the person will start thinking from at least a different point of view. Okay. Then we start challenging that. Then we challenge the all the behavior and all the underlying beliefs for that behavior. So that is how we go ahead we there is a lot of challenging to the belief that happens. So that is the approach of CBT. I personally use CBT when it comes to my therapy sessions. And there is a very systematic way to do that also. But yeah, I have given you a very brief introduction about the therapy. Basically, it's all about our own perspectives and how we think. What our beliefs lie. Uh, in that also, you know, my core personality, like i said, was a very anxious personality. So maybe there were other events also, or maybe in my household itself, I have always been in a very fight or flight mode that made me have that belief system. Okay. So yes, CBT works on a very deeper level, but cbt does not take your past into account. Other therapies take your childhood into account, take everything into account. CBT is very present focused. is very, okay, right now you are having this issue, we are dealing with this issue and that's it, done. We don't go in the past. So, and the moment you come to know that, okay, I can challenge these thoughts right here, right now, we implement that in the other upcoming events also. So that is what the gist of CBT is. It will not take into consideration your past or childhood experiences, which other therapies usually go. "

Okay. So, um, you know, there is this one particular study which says that when we are in a situation where our anger response triggers, if we even try to control that anger, it somehow rewires our brain in adjusting to how to manage aggression. Okay, so first would be to actually not say anything. It is a very, very hard thing to do, yes, but that would be the first thing, yes, to actually not say anything to control all our emotions. Second would be Now there are few resources that I personally use. Now I have another resource which has a body outline and I ask the client to tell where they feel aggression. Now every person has different different areas in which they feel aggression. Few people feel it over here that is where the verbal aggression starts coming. Okay they start cursing, they start using abusive language. There are few people who will have a lot of aggression over here. There are too many thoughts coming and suddenly the mind gets heavy. There are people who feel aggression over here in the hands. They just feel like punching something. There are people who feel it in the gut area. So they scribble and I ask them to scribble any body part where they feel the aggression. is accumulated and they scribble and the way they scribble just this one activity helps a lot in anger management helps a lot in anger management so that is one thing that you can do second is the tightening of the muscles and releasing that will that works wonders when it comes to aggression so yeah that is how you can deal with aggression "

fact,What should I do if I'm experiencing symptoms of burnout or overwhelm?,"Dealing with burnout is a common struggle many of us face on a daily basis. The root cause often lies in overexerting ourselves, pushing beyond our limits. Take, for instance, the pressure 10th and 12th-grade students experience during exam season. The weight of covering vast syllabi can become overwhelming, leading to a loss of focus and motivation. This lack of concentration is a telltale sign of burnout. My go-to recommendation? Take a break. Give yourself permission to step away from the books and indulge in activities unrelated to your tasks. Whether it's playing sports, engaging in charity work, or simply unwinding outdoors, disconnecting from the stress can work wonders for your mental well-being. Upon returning, ease back into your routine gradually. Create a manageable timetable, starting with simpler tasks before tackling more challenging ones. Remember to intersperse your study sessions with regular breaks to prevent exhaustion. By recognizing the signs of burnout and implementing preventive measures like pacing yourself and taking breaks, you can navigate through overwhelming periods with greater ease and resilience."
fact,How do you approach issues related to trauma or past experiences?,"So when trauma is involved, so we need to first understand the nature of trauma. We need to understand what the trauma has caused to the client. Is it a physical loss? Is it a mental loss? What is it exactly that the trauma has created? Releasing trauma is not easy. Challenging trauma is not easy. Trauma-based therapies are usually focused on accepting the trauma and working on changing your belief once you have accepted the trauma. You are living with it. So, yes, the approach first would be to accept that yes, this is something that has happened to me. This is my life story. I can either cry about it or I can take it with me and have a much better life for myself. I can make a much better life for myself with the experiences. So that is something that we first, as therapists, we first aim at. The acceptance. And the acceptance also has a lot of stages. There is a lot of grief involved. A lot of emotional venting is involved. A lot of physically challenging stuff is involved. There are certain traumas that are so, so well ingrained that the body starts shivering. We engage in a lot of physical activities so that the trauma somewhere or the other gets a physical outlet to come out of the body. And trauma resides in the body. Trauma, anxiety, depression all of them resides in the mind and equally in the body also. So we work a lot from the mind and body perspective. "

fact,Is it very difficult for a girl to live life her own way on her own terms and conditions?,"I believe in today's generation, I believe the gender over here is irrelevant. Okay. Because guys also face the same amount of issues, the same amount of difficulties, but in other areas of life. Okay. And girls face such difficulties in other areas of life. So, you know, they say that, and this is something that I have personally experienced also. We would always be very cautious like when it comes to girls. They would always be cautious. You know, if you are going out at 10 o'clock at night, how can you even think of it? No, no, no, no, no. But unfortunately, right now we are living in an era where if 10 o'clock is very, very dangerous for a girl to go out, 10 o'clock is equally dangerous for a boy to go out also now. Okay? Again, we are, we are, we live in a society where we encourage boys not to feel anything. Okay? That is why they don't even acknowledge the difficulties that they are getting.Because it is always I can do it you know they are just, yes, yes, man up, man up. And they are only repressing their difficulties and their strengths to challenge these difficulties. Whereas when it comes to a woman, we are very very aware of the difficulties, we are very very aware of the challenges. And that is why we know we have to handle them. And that is why the difficulty part comes when, typically when it comes to a woman. But again, if you have not even acknowledged something, that the difficulty is there you are just putting forth walls of you know i can't i don't feel anything i am able to manage it the more you do that the more difficulty you are creating for yourself you are living in that false hope of i i can deal with anything i do not have challenges that is much more worst than a girl dealing with her challenges."
fact,how to build healthier relationships?,"okay very important first yes very very important but first when we talk about relationship, we usually focus on building relationship with others. Instead, if we just Talk about building a healthier relationship with ourselves. That will change the whole game. Okay. First, building a much healthier relationship with ourselves. First, actually acknowledging where we are lacking, what we are doing, what we are not doing. Where do we see ourselves in a particular point of time? Do we possess the skills which the ideal self wants to possess or not? First, validating those feelings. Having a good relationship with yourself, actually acknowledging that you know what, however you are, this is who I am, this is who we are. I usually do this activity with myself in front of the mirror to have a much healthier sense of self. And the more healthier sense of self, the more healthier self-relation you have, the more healthier you will automatically attract the outside emotion because you will set certain boundaries for yourself. This is something that I will not accept because this is something I do not see myself accepting. So even when the other person starts behaving in a particular manner, which is not appropriate in terms of your own worth, you will automatically disengage with the person. And you will start engaging with people who appreciate that worth which you see in yourself. So, yeah. That is how you can build. First, build a healthier relationship with yourself and then focus on building relationships with others. "
fact,"Why can't I fall asleep, and why aren't I able to feel empathy and understand others","First is, you know, a sleeping disorder or any sort of disorder, especially when it comes to sleeping, sleep helps us to rest. Now, when our subconscious mind is constantly working, if we have an anxious subconscious, then our subconscious mind is constantly bombarding itself with a lot of thoughts. and those thoughts, when they try to come on the surface level, like, they are so strong, they become so strong that they start imposing themselves on the conscious level also. And once that starts to happen, no matter how much tired you are, you will not be able to sleep. So, first, again, over here, it is very important that we first calm our subconscious. Again, meditation helps a lot, but before meditation also, understand what is the cause of those, you know, thoughts. The cause of all these anxious thoughts that are coming in. And for that, there are very different techniques. One of the techniques that i go ahead is that free flow technique. I ask the client to just start saying whatever is coming into their mind and they are and you know, close your eyes, relax a little bit. Just start saying whatever is coming to your mind. And they start narrating. And usually it is... They start going beyond. And that is where you come to know all the different areas which can cause trouble to the subconscious. The moment we tap into that, there's a list that we present. That, okay, these are the points I believe is causing a lot of trouble. And then we work on those points one by one. Even when we tackle one thing at a time, there is a lot of improvement in the sleep area. So, that is how we go ahead. Again, for the immediate benefit, you go for medications and everything, but medications will never penetrate beyond the surface. It only works on the surface. So, yes. And the second question is why aren't i able to feel empathy and understand others okay so um from a clinical point of view, there is a personality disorder called narcissistic personality disorder in which the person is incapable of understanding the other person's emotion because they are too bound with what they are feeling. Okay, they want to be the center of attention. They cannot help if someone else is getting attention.They will go to any means to get to that attention. And these people, you know, people with narcissistic personality disorder usually are unable to feel empathy. The only difference is that they do not realize that they are not able to feel empathy and understand they feel that they do. and they will defend themselves and they will try to you know manipulate their words in such a manner that the other person will come to know and they will themselves be like yeah you know what this is my fault this is my fault and they go down that guilt spiral and that is why the relationship between a narcissistic personality disorder person and other people is very very toxic but over here, if you, if the person is able to understand the difference that you, okay, I want to, but i cannot feel empathy and understand each other, others, that could be because they are not able to first understand themselves.Now, always remember, everything starts within you. Okay. So even if you are not able to feel empathy or you are not able to understand the other person, That means deep down somewhere there is a need to first understand yourself. Our bodies, our mind will always build up a lot of barriers to protect our own self. This is also a defense mechanism."

fact,Addictions are hard to overcome as urge to leave them increases the addiction to hit harder . It can also lead to withdraw syndrome. What are the alternatives or more efficient ways to completely over come addiction ,"When it comes to addiction, no matter what you are addicted to, the withdrawal symptoms are usually very, very similar in all addictions. Addiction made the dopamine gets released so much and on an intense intensity where dopamine is the feel-good hormone. Dopamine is the addiction hormone, the feel-good hormone. Dopamine basically handles all of this. Now when the secretion of dopamine, if you are engaged, let's take alcohol over here as an example. The moment you engage in drinking, Your dopamine is released, you are feeling good. Dopamine is released, you are feeling good. The moment you engage, dopamine suddenly goes down and then you are getting a reaction. You know, you start crying, you start doing everything. That is because the dopamine level has gone down. To maintain that same level of dopamine, you are engaging in the second peg, the third peg, the fourth peg. you are engaging in having drinks because you want that level of dopamine to be stagnant. Now the moment you decide to stop, the dopamine level is decreased. Your body is used to a certain level of dopamine. Your body knows how to function to that level of dopamine. Certain decrease in dopamine, your body does not know how to manage. Your body has no idea what you can do. the body will react. The body will help you. You know, you will get urges. The body will be like, So, it will, your body will only make you go and engage in the addiction addictive behavior. If you are trying to control that, it becomes very difficult because your body will actually shiver. And withdrawal phase depending on the intensity and the substance that you are using, withdrawal can last from, for two days to one week also. And it is not a very, very good thing for your body and for your mind because it is a state of complete panic okay again with because under the influence of few substances during withdrawal phase, you get hallucinations. Okay, so there is a kind of psychosis that starts popping in during the withdrawal phase itself. Because the body is, the body will do anything. The body will go to any extreme to make you engaged in that activity because it knows how to function at that level of dopamine. And once you deficit the body from that level, it will go to any extremes. Your body then just takes over. Okay. My suggestion would be if you don't want to go to, now, to deal with addiction,  we usually treat addictions first hand with the medications. Because withdrawal symptoms are very very intense the medications only help them reduce the withdrawal symptoms. Okay. But even if you decide not to take the psycho-pharmacological approach towards it, I would suggest to go step by step. Now, there is again a very systematic approach that we take over here. If your intensity of consuming alcohol is one and a half bottle per day, one and a half bottle is huge. If you have that intensity every day, I will start in the morning and finish at night. Then we might come down to using one bottle only. See how much you are able to manage it. Okay. Your body, it is, you know, addiction and withdrawal is such that your body has gone to the eighth floor and now you are asking it to jump to the ground, which does not happen."
fact,I over care & help people close to me . Though I have no much expectations from them but still I feel ignored sometimes over others,"When the people pleasing attitude close to me over caring yes when people are close to you, you tend to go beyond your limits to do to make them feel everything uh you know over here, the many expectations would, I would, when it comes to reality, if you are over caring on a very minimal uh level the expectations come. the expectations always come. So, we cannot say that people are, you know, there are no expectations at all. I still feel ignored sometimes over others. The reason that you are even able to feel the ignorance is because of the expectation. Okay. So, understand that, okay, on a very minimal level, expectations are already there. So maybe if you think that you are over caring, maybe limit your care so that your expectations are somewhere, you know, managed. So it's okay, even if they do that, it's fine. But then what will happen, you will automatically see the things that they actually do. And you will not see the ignorance part. Because you have just limited your own over caring behavior. you go in a very observant attitude and you actually observe small small things and in that process you will also observe that the things that they actually do. Obviously in this also the person will feel ignored because that is like the motto, that is what they have come up with. Okay, they will always be like let me see how much they ignore me now. so in that process, the bigger picture of the outcome will always be focused on the ignorance. And they might, you know, they might themselves ignore the small things that the other person does. But it does make you vigilant. It does make you see the small things, the small changes that the other person does. It is up to the person how much importance they would like to give to that. So, again, over here, personality cuts So, yeah. So, it is also said, right, that over caring and over doing things for others is also not actually healthy, in a way it is a defense like I said it is a people pleasing attitude it is a defense because you want to feel belonged. You want to feel loved. You think if you are giving so much, the other person will at least give back something. And that something is, you know, is what you want. Alright. So, it is a very defensive behavior. People pleasing. It is a very defensive behavior. And the moment defenses come, you should be aware enough to see that, okay, this is not coming from a very healthy place. So, yes. The moment you start looking at things from a very healthy point of view, the over caring will not come. The overdoing will not come, the expectation will not come and even if you're feeling ignored, it will not affect you."
fact,How to be happy with our own self,"It is majorly because happiness does not involve the material world, the materials at all. It is your sense of self, your sense of well-being that ultimately makes you happy. Over here, you know, the angle of spirituality is a lot connected to this in the material world because spirituality just helps you elevate your personal level beyond the material. That even if you have nothing, you still have the capacity to be happier. And I think, you know, COVID actually taught us that. We had nothing. Like, for one and a half years, we were just locked in our own houses and living on the basic stuff. But still, there were so many families that, you know, they would make amazing dishes each day and they would have like such grand feasts every day. "
fact,What does actually unhealthy mental health mean...and how can it be overcomed,"Unhealthy mental health encompasses a range of struggles unique to each individual. While practices like meditation, positive affirmations, and exercise can contribute to well-being, they may not suffice for everyone. The journey to mental peace is deeply personal and begins with self-awareness and self-acceptance. Understanding one's flaws, strengths, and weaknesses is crucial before external modalities can effectively help. Meditation, for instance, may not be the ideal solution for extreme anxiety. However, exercise can serve as a powerful tool, as the mind and body are intricately connected—a healthy body often leads to a healthier mind, and vice versa. Thus, overcoming unhealthy mental health involves a personalized approach that acknowledges individual struggles and seeks to address them holistically, with self-acceptance as the foundation."
fact,How to balance mental health in this era,"Balancing mental health in today's era is a complex endeavor, as each person's experience is unique. While practices like meditation, positive affirmations, and exercise can be beneficial, they may not offer a universal solution. Achieving mental well-being starts with self-awareness and self-acceptance. Understanding one's flaws, strengths, and weaknesses is crucial before external strategies can effectively contribute. For instance, while meditation can be helpful, it may not fully address the stressors of modern life. Exercise, however, offers a tangible way to improve both physical and mental health, given the profound connection between mind and body. Therefore, maintaining mental balance requires a personalized approach that acknowledges individual challenges and seeks to address them holistically, with self-acceptance as the cornerstone."
fact,"Should i be truthful to therapist and like tell everything from get go, i scared that they might judge me rather than help","So, you should be, now over here, I will present both approaches to you you should be truthful to your therapist, yes. But, you should first be comfortable with your therapist. Okay. If you are not comfortable with your therapist, the truthfulness will never come. No matter how much you want to try. the moment you feel comfortable with your therapist, that is where the truthfulness will automatically come into service. If you do not feel comfortable, you have the power to change your therapist also. Okay. At any point now, a therapist is not allowed to judge because that goes against the whole therapy scene. Okay. If you feel that the therapist has judged, now it is in a therapy session, it is not the therapist who is in power. No, no, no. It is the person who is in power. We are just here to help them identify what they are going through. The underlying cause of their behavior or their cognition. But we are not in charge over here. Okay. So if you think that a person, the therapist has judged you, You can actually let them know that I am feeling just over here. And that is not why I have come here. If the therapist is just making you feel, then you might as well go to your friends and not the therapist. So that is not what a therapy should be like. If you feel that it has come. Coming to the question of truthfulness, yes, because what happens is the more open you are, the much more broader... aspect of your personality, of your approach towards the situation is presented in front of the therapist and the therapist can help you identify all the patterns that are already existing in your behavior. Again, but it is up to you whether you want to be truthful or not. The therapist will only and only work on the information you are providing. Nothing else. So, yes. "
fact,What are some techniques for improving my communication skills?,"First, communication skills. There are actually many online courses available for that. Okay, when we go for communication skills. But first, I would suggest start the mirroring work. First, always have the sense of self. How you... Improving communication is... goes hand in hand in improving confidence. So we can actually use the same answer for lack of confidence that we discussed earlier with this. Engage in a lot of self-talk, positive self-talk in front of the mirror. Communicate with yourself in front of the mirror. See how you are responding. See your body posture. See whether, you know, you are engaging in a lot of hand gestures or not. Hand gestures. Yes, take it. Make use of your hands. Make use of your body. To express. The more you do that. First. The tension of the communication. Gets divided. It is not just your mouth. Which will feel all the pressure. That what am I saying. What am I doing. It is also the hands that will come in play. It is also your expressions that will come in play. The more you engage in such. The mouth will be like, okay, even if you miss a word, okay, if the mouth is at the center, if the mouth is like, you know, if your focus is only on the words that you're saying out of your mouth, the moment you miss a particular word, anxiety starts crawling. But the moment you use your hands, the moment you use your body to express, you'll be like, you understood, right? You understood what I'm trying to say. So you kind of compensate the forgetfulness through all these expressions so that the other person gets the exact idea what you are trying to say without you feeling the anxiety. "
fact,How can I navigate difficult emotions such as anger or sadness in a healthy way?,"um navigating emotions in a healthy way now again uh i would want some clarity on this is the anger and uh you know regret or whatever because of the lack of things that you have you wanted to do and couldn't do. Or just a general sense of sadness. Because when a general sense of sadness comes, then the approach towards it changes. But if it is just regret of not being able to do what you planned on doing, then the other treatment starts. So what are you asking about? So first let's generalize it. to become like, to make it easier for us okay. alright first you should always know when it comes to aggression. Aggression is the secondary emotion. Okay, secondary emotion which just comes so that the primary emotion can go back. Primary emotions are usually sadness or anxiety or anything. But anger is never the first emotion. Okay, so first we need to understand that. The moment we understand on the aggression part, then we focus on the primary which is hurt or sadness or any other emotion that we are feeling. On a day to day basis, if we want to focus on that, again, like I said, it is how you are perceiving the situation. The intensity of sadness depends over here. My approach to dealing with such situation is actually going through the feeling and recognizing the factors that are affecting you. Yes. The moment you recognize the factors and actually accept that yes, these factors exist. These are the feelings that I have towards all these factors which are affecting me. That is when you will actually validate your feelings. The moment these negative emotions get validated, that is when these negative emotions will make space for the positive ones to overcome. Our body body always knows how to protect ourselves, but it doesn't protect us because we are unable to validate the original response. The moment you validate the original response, the body will automatically bring up ways with which it can manage these emotions. If suppose the body is unable to bring the ways, I would suggest again going to the relaxing techniques. Now these relaxing techniques are like the go-to for everything. Be it stress, be it managing your heavy emotions, be it managing just basic not so good emotions. So yeah like that is like the first aid to every stress related or mental health related problem that we are facing. So yeah that would also help."
fact,Can you suggest mindfulness or relaxation exercises to incorporate into my routine?,"Alright. One particular mindfulness technique I'd like to share involves doing things very slowly and deliberately, using all your senses. For example, when writing, feel the texture of the pen, listen to the sound it makes, and observe its appearance. This method encourages deep sensory engagement, fostering mindfulness in everyday activities. Another technique is the 5-4-3-2-1 method, which prompts you to engage all your senses in the present moment. Start by observing five things around you, then focus on four things you can hear, three things you can touch, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This practice helps ground you in the present and promotes mindfulness."
fact,How do I recognize signs of burnout and prevent it from happening?,"A topic that I acknowledge almost every day. Burnouts. Now, first you need to understand that the cause of burnout is because you overexerted yourself. So, first try to manage situations in which you are not overexerting yourself. I would like to give one of the examples, a basic example that almost all 10th and 12th standard students go through lately is because, you know, boards are there. So they try to manage and they try to cover up their syllabus starting way. But it creates so much pressure that later on, they just don't feel like picking up the textbook and opening and studying. And even if they do that, they are not able to focus. That is like first and the basic thing. sign of burnout. You are not able to focus on the task that you are required to do. My first suggestion, my go-to suggestion is take a break. Take a break. It's okay. One day, just forget about your books yeah forget about the problem in hand. Go out somewhere. Take a break. Go out, play. Go out, to And, you know, if you are a very social person and if you like to do charity, go out, do charity. If you are more of a play kind of a person, go out, exert your body into play. But that one day, give yourself that one day so that you are actually engaging in activities which is not remotely related to the problem or the task of focus. so that is what you can, and then the moment you come back with a refreshed frame of mind, start slow. Do not again get in that rut okay okay you know, I have so many things to do. No, start slow. First, make a timetable. Okay, what are the basic things that i need to focus upon right now? Start with the easier one, then take the, take a little harder one. then second, take again the easier one. Then maybe take a little much more harder subject to study upon. Then take an easier one. Then take a rest. Then take a break. Revise all the chapters that you have covered. But take a break. Do not over exert yourself. So yes, you can recognizing the science would be you are not able to focus on what you need to do. Preventing it from happening is bifurcate your task. go in one step at a time. Give yourself constant breaks. So yes, that is how you can go ahead with it. "
fact,How to deal with depression?,"First, depression is... In depression, there are few common signs like, you know, you lose appetite, there's a lot of sleep involved or reduced sleep involved. There are... In certain cases, there are suicidal ideations. But the underlying core is having a very, very low... Self-esteem. A very low view of self. Okay. So once we start targeting that, that is where we can actually channel the depression into something that can be productive.So how can one come out of depression first uh we usually go with the intensity of the depression. If the intensity is pretty severe, then we, our first model of treatment is medicines. Yes, antidepressant second model of one, the person comes in a state where, okay, they can actually comprehend. That is when the therapy starts. The therapy focuses on their routine, what their usual pattern is because depression is a disorder where you basically do not get motivation to do anything and that that is where we try to target. We start giving them certain basic basic techniques certain basic basic activities which you know, they can do on a daily basis so that they can get a self uh sense of achievement. And once the sense of achievement starts, that is when we can start targeting on other aspects also to bring in a much major change. "
fact,How to change today's people 's mindset?,"fostering mindset change around gender equality involves compassionately addressing underlying beliefs and biases. Start by creating a safe space for open dialogue where individuals can explore their thoughts and feelings without judgment. Use education and storytelling to challenge stereotypes and highlight the benefits of gender equality. Encourage empathy by promoting understanding of diverse experiences. Patience and persistence are key, as mindset shifts require time and ongoing effort. By modeling inclusive behavior and engaging in meaningful conversations, we can gradually influence change towards a more equitable society."
fact,How should parents raise their children in today's world?,"Parents often struggle to balance providing for their children's needs with spending quality time. They invest in top education and resources but may unrealistically expect perfect academic results without understanding their child's true capabilities. This pressure can be more stressful than external competition. I frequently encounter this as a certified career counselor. Some parents insist on specific careers like medicine, overlooking their child's talents in art or other areas. Career counseling should align with the child's strengths and interests, exploring innovative fields like virtual reality, design, or architecture that blend science and art. There's a misconception among parents that only traditional professions lead to success. However, modern opportunities span diverse fields where passion and talent can lead to financial success. Parents need awareness and flexibility to support their child's unique path to achievement."
fact,How to deal with superstitious people?,"When it comes to psychology, you need to again focus on the intensity of the superstition. Now what happens is superstition and delusion, delusions are fall beliefs, okay. And superstition and delusion goes a lot hand in hand. So if the intensity of superstition increases a lot, then there is a tendency that the person might develop delusional disorder. I will not leave the house if it is a Monday because I think something bad will happen to me.So, the person is just not leaving the house. Okay. I will tap three times and then go off. Okay. Because then I think something bad will happen so yeah so it is it lies on the same plane but again depends on the intensity. Now, if the intensity you feel is very very high then go and recommend a proper psychiatrist to those people because they require immediate medications uh if superstition like if the intensity is low you can help them challenge okay okay let's see what happens i am also there with you nothing bad will happen to you if anything bad happens it will happen to both of us so let's try and challenge it together so that is something that you can do."
fact,How to deal with egoistic people?,"Understand how much they are rigid in terms of their own beliefs if you think that they are rigid enough and they are not at all able to, you know, help themselves. Then I think if the context in which they are rigid goes against your personal beliefs, then I would suggest maintain a distance. Now always remember it is your mental health that you need to take care of. It is not the other person's view that you want to change. So that is what I would suggest. If you think that the person is at least capable enough of understanding your point of view. Okay, great. But if you think that the person is just not able to understand that and is still very, very rigid in their own terms, distance yourself for a little while and just tell them, you know, very nicely, very nicely just tell them, say, this is what I believe and I understand your belief also, but this is what I believe. Our beliefs don't align with each other. It's better that we either agree to disagree or maintain a distance and then come back on other topics on which you guys are on the same plane"
fact,How to move past irrelevant things?,"First, you need to understand those are irrelevant things.People do not realize the difference between Yes, this is something that is important to me and this is something that is not very important but still I am focusing on it. Again, a trait of anxiety. So, yes, the same approach what we use for anxiety which is relaxing the body first and then going and challenging the thoughts that are coming into your minds. That is the same thing that we will use over here also. We also use a few... advantages and disadvantages check resources also where we ask the client to list down the advantages of thinking a particular thing the thinking are irrelevant or a relevant thought and the disadvantages of thinking and then they can compare the two and that again helps them to get a very clear understanding okay whatever i was thinking is not exactly that important but these things are important so i have better focus over here "
fact,How to increase gender equality among people?,"Certainly! It's important to consciously understand and address societal issues. For instance, I grew up in an open-minded environment but was unfamiliar with the LGBTQ community until my roommate in university, who was bisexual, educated me through conversations and rallies. I learned about their struggles, especially in less accepting areas like rural India. Changing societal views takes time. Some argue against LGBTQ relationships from a biological standpoint, but society now prioritizes mental well-being over old norms. Despite facing criticism based on caste and gender, awareness fosters progress. Even small personal changes contribute to broader societal shifts over time."
fact,How to generate good mindset from home?,"The role of parents is the major thing. I don't think there is anything that can go beyond it also. The role of parents is very very important but that does not mean, even if role of parents is important, it is the primary role that we focus upon.If the parents provide a very, you know, Empowering, very motivating uh household to the child. There is a generally good sense, good overall sense. So even if the child fails, they know okay yes i i will hear from my parents but they will not take any extreme step. Okay, so the child himself is in a very, very safe position internally. But when it comes to distorted families, the child will first never feel safe at home itself. So there is no way that they can build up good sense of anything that happens. Good mindset. Because they are always on alert. Anything can happen at any moment. So they have a very general high alert sense of everything. These people usually go ahead and generate a very people pleasing attitude or a very distant attitude that don't come near me, I don't want to, you know, like basically distancing themselves from everyone because they internally do not realize that they have this need to be taken care of. They want to, okay, there are again two extremes over here. They want to be taken care of and they can go to any extremes to again heal that one since they will not realize the difference between healthy and unhealthy. And they will just go there. They have this tendency of people pleasing. They have this tendency of saying sorries and thank yous every time. They are always high alert. Even a minute difference in the other person's attitude will affect them so much that they usually are incapable of handling it.And hence they also engage in behavior that is just a cycle of what their parents were doing. Okay. So that is how it goes ahead. So when it comes over here, the role of parents is very, very important. But if you still want to have a good mindset towards the house, you can at least, you know, help yourself create your safe space. Suppose you have your room and the moment you go out of the room, things are very different in the house. Okay. go back to your room. Find one appropriate moment where you can go out, deal with everything and then come back. Create the safe space over here. And if you have a good mindset, if you are strong build which happens around when you are mature enough to understand what is happening when there is a baby involved, they will not see what is happening, what is not happening. It gets very, very difficult for them to handle this stuff. But if you are a mature adult and if all these things are happening with you, I would suggest create a safe space for your own self. If you have a room already and no one usually enters, be in that room. Start doing creative work, the things that you are fond of. You can paint, you can edit videos, you can make videos, you can learn, you can do whatever you want. But ensure that it is your space and something that you want to do. Obviously, at the back of the mind, things are always running. When people do not get a good household, at the back of their mind, things are always, always running.Maybe calm them down also. Engage in activities, relaxing activities, exercises and everything that will help you strengthen your mind so that you are better able to deal with the situation. So, this is how I would suggest create a safe space for your own senses or just a safe corner where the moment you go, just everything just shuts off."
fact,How to create humanity between the people?,"So, creating humanity between people is something we can explore together. It often starts with recognizing the value of empathy and compassion in our interactions. We can work on actively listening to others, understanding their perspectives, and fostering connection through meaningful conversations. It's about finding ways to show kindness and support to those around us, even in small gestures. We can also explore promoting inclusivity and diversity to build a more compassionate and understanding community. Together, we can work on cultivating these qualities in your interactions with others, helping you navigate relationships with greater empathy and humanity."
fact,Why people not spending more time with their kids?,"Okay. so over here, we need to have a much more broader view on things. When I say that uh in today's economy, okay, before how it was, because of the economy, yes, it was only the man of the house would go and the mother would take care of the children because that was what was required. Okay, the man will bring back uh money and the women will take care of the money and buy resources for the house. Now, because of the economy it is it is very very important for both man and the women to go outside of the house and bring home the money because not just one person can survive or and when there is a whole family involved, today it is extremely difficult to sustain a family in just one person's income. 
extremely difficult. Because of that both men and women are now engaging in their work. Because they are engaging in their work, they are not able to spend the minimal quality time which is required for the child for their healthy development. Because that "
fact,Why people not keeping their old parents to their home?,"Alright, so here we need to take a broader perspective. In the past, due to economic circumstances, it was common for the man of the house to work while the mother took care of the children and managed household finances. However, with today's economy, it's essential for both men and women to work outside the home to support their families. Relying solely on one person's income has become increasingly challenging. Consequently, both parents are now involved in their careers, leaving little time to care for their aging parents. This shift has resulted in a lack of attention and support for the elderly in their family."
fact,How to teach today's kid competitive world?,"Competition can be motivating, but it must be approached with a healthy mindset. Understanding one's strengths and weaknesses is crucial for realistic expectations and self-validation. Parents often pressure their children due to high expectations based on providing the best education and resources. However, this pressure stems from parents' lack of awareness about their children's true capabilities and interests.
As a certified career counselor, I frequently encounter parents fixated on traditional career paths like medicine or engineering, disregarding their child's unique talents. Integrative fields combining science and art offer exciting career opportunities, but parental rigidity and unawareness often limit these options. Success is not limited to specific professions in today's diverse economy, where various skills can lead to lucrative careers."
fact,How to teach parents  don't pressurize their kids?,"Competition is essential for motivation but should be approached realistically. Understanding one's strengths and weaknesses is crucial. Unrealistic expectations only lead to unnecessary pressure. Parents often pressure children due to lack of time and awareness of their capabilities. They expect top performance after providing the best resources, unaware of the child's actual potential. This parental pressure, not just competition, often overwhelms children. Career counseling can bridge gaps between parental expectations and a child's true interests, integrating diverse fields like art and science into fulfilling career paths. Parents need awareness of modern career opportunities beyond traditional professions like engineering and medicine.






"
fact,Why parents not want to talk about gender equality?,"As a therapist, I often encourage parents to approach these discussions with an open mind and a willingness to learn alongside their children. It's essential to create a safe and non-judgmental space where questions can be asked and feelings can be explored. By acknowledging their own uncertainties and being open to growth, parents can model a positive attitude towards learning and understanding, ultimately fostering healthier conversations about gender equality within the family."
fact,Why people running behind reputation?,"Why do you think? Society? Competition, again. The competition, the more higher the stand, the more higher on the competitive scale you are, the more people will see you as a figure of power. The more people see you as a figure of power, the more your sense of, you know, yes, I am something just strengthens. The more your sense of I am something strengthens, even one comment that goes against that belief will make you, make everything scatter in your own life. And yes, you should have a very good sense of your own reputation. Again, everything starts from within. Have a very, very good sense of who you really are. Do not see on what scale on the societal aspect you are working upon. Yes, you do see that. It brings a lot of joy also. But Be humble enough to say that if today I am here, 10 years down the line, there will come someone who will even exceed me. I need to be prepared for that. So that is something that is very, very important. "
fact,How to remove caste system from people mindset?,"Yeah, like you said, you know, I was just about to correct you that we cannot remove it unless you put in conscious efforts to actually understand those consequences. Now, I would like to give a very good example over here. My own example, okay. So, I have always been raised in a very... I have been raised in a very open society, no doubt. But, you know, the concept of LGBTQ community was very foreign to me. It was during the Masters that one of my roommates, she was bisexual and she actually taught me and she even took me to some of her rallies and I engaged in a lot of conversation with other people and I could... actually come to know the struggles that those community faces in the society. There are so many remote areas in India that is still not accepting. There are so many cultures that are not accepting of the existence of the community itself. So, yes, I am not saying that we need to fix that. No, you cannot. It is generationally long you know, way of thinking. And if you go from a very biological point of view also, you make a lot of sense if a man and a woman is engaged in a relationship. But it makes no sense at all that a woman and a woman are engaged in relationship because that is against biology. And not just against biology, against so many things. But today, We cannot really expect that because today we are giving a lot of importance to the mental well-being of a person than their societal things. We still face a lot of caste criticism. We still face a lot of gender inequality. Those are certain things that we still face but the more you get aware of certain areas of life, the more you are willing to put in efforts to understand that those areas exist and yes they are problematic areas in the society and that will only make the society not progress in a good manner if you are willing to bring a very minute change within yourself you are ultimately doing a lot of good in the coming 10 years where this is not accepted today becomes inculcated in the society. But that will only start if you are willing to make those changes within yourself. Everything is under our control.

This is like the notion that of kind people we have. You know. A strong person, like if I ask you what is your definition of a strong person? I'm 100% sure I will receive an answer where You will be like who takes decisions for themselves. A kind person, you know, from the notion of the society, a kind person is not allowed to do that. So yes, they are considered weak. And also because they invest a lot of their time in emotions. And again, emotional person is a weak person. You are crying the whole day. Can't even handle a basic thing. Whereas crying is a very, very healthy map. healthy thing to do. You are giving your body a lot of relief by crying things out. So that you can inculcate more things. But people do not understand "
fact,Why don't  add mental health wellness topics on school book?,"This is actually one of the challenges that unfortunately all schools are facing. But now with the current CBSE guidelines and, you know, current education system guidelines, a lot of importance is given. One of the challenges, like one of those approaches, one of the steps that they have taken is they have appointed one school counsellor in each school. It is mandatory now to have a school counsellor. Even though the mental health topics are not involved, at least you have someone with whom you can go and share. But yes, now again there is a proposition to involve a lot of mental health related topics so that basic management of emotions is at least being taught to the children. That is also in progress now. Let's see what the future holds. "
fact,dbt and cbt techniques and motivational interviewing,"so dbt is uh dialect behavior therapy okay dialect behavior therapy now dialect is dialogue. Okay, the way you say. DBT involves a lot of the way you say and approach the situation. Now any situation can be I don't want to be negative. And the same sentence could be I want to be positive. It's the same sentence but I don't want to be negative is you still giving the negativity a little power. But I want to be positive is a firm statement. And then you focus on that. I am not jealous. I feel that I will be able to overcome that. So these are certain you know the dialects the way you say things out and the more you say things out loud, the more that type of thoughts start coming in. Okay, so dialect behavior therapy works on those aspects. Yeah, got it. And motivation, like CBT, I have already told you. And motivation is what I said that we use in the addiction part. Basically, making the person realize that right now because of their addiction or because of the activities they are engaging it what is it that they are compromising? Where do they see themselves if they continue with this and if they don't continue with this? So that is how then we try to motivate the person. "
fact,why therapy so expensive ,"So there's like this scarcity. The more therapists come and the more people actually start engaging in a lot of therapy sessions, the prices will automatically come down. You know, currently in the outer scenario, it is such that the demand is high, but the need is not there. But the demand is there. It works on that principle. The demand is there, but only... few people will come and actually take that. And as professionals, we also have a house to maintain. We also have to go back. Okay, we require that basic sum. So yeah, therapy, that is why therapy is expensive. Second, therapy talks about your emotions. Okay, now it is something that you actively need to engage. It is the work of the therapist to deal with emotions. Emotions are very very fickle it is not a product that you are putting in few things and you are getting out the result. No. It is not that it is it is a lot of trial and error. Okay. There are many things that are involved and most of all there is a lot of emotional investment from both the parties. Okay. And if you are emotionally being invested, you should be worthy enough to have that investment. and one more thing that is my personal point of view, I feel, is because if things, when you add value to things, you actually work upon it. I, when, during my training phase, I gave out many more many resources my own resources to so many of my friends because it will help them and it was all free of cost. And till date, they have not opened the resource and even completed one activity. My own mother has not done that. Even now I know that file is there that I made for her. It is still kept over here. I remember everything. Still that file is not opened. Why? Because it was free of cost. And anything free of cost is never valued. "

Be it a romantic involvement, be it just a friendship. A breakup is a break you go through all the effects of a breakup you go through all the phases of grief that I had shared before you go through all of that okay so the dealing process is also similar first you need to make a mint that okay something like this has happened the denial stage kicks in then the aggression comes how dare you do that how dare then the bargain comes it's like i must have done something wrong then the depression comes when you're crying and trying and trying and trying and then the acceptance be humble to yourself to go through these phases we are never humble with ourselves we are always in that you know posture is like why is he doing why is he doing uh second would be if that person has like this is a very personal uh suggestion that I would give, if a person has left you for someone else, it is actually good for you. Because maybe in a longer run, it would have been much more difficult for you to deal with it. Because the friendship would have been much more stronger. Okay. So if they have left you in a particular state, be glad that, okay, it was here and not five years down the line where the hurt would be much more intense. So yeah, but again requires a lot of efforts to even think from that point of view. My suggestion would be go through the grief stages. It is a loss. It's a huge loss. But you can only come out of it if you go through it. "
fact,how to Stop getting bothered by what people think of me,"First have a very strong sense of self. What you think of yourself. Okay, and you can do that through exploring your own self.

You know, starting from such basic questions. it. The more you explore yourself, the more you will come to know your own self, the more you will have a stronger sense of self. Now, when you are developing a stronger sense of self, if anyone in the outside society even challenges that sense, that you are like this and you are like no I am not like this what will happen is, if you are not strong enough over here, if the sense of self is not strong enough, you will try to take that point of view and you will apply it on yourself. Yes, I am not good enough she is right, I am not good enough. But the moment you develop the sense of self, you will be like, no, what are you saying, ma'am? Like I know myself, I live with myself, you are not even here. So I know that I can deal with the situation. You are not aware of that part of me and it is completely fine. It is completely fine. But I know how I am. So the moment you have that, the outside comments and everything will not affect you much. I'm not saying that it will have zero effect on you. Everything has effects. But you will at least be able to manage it in a much more positive manner. "
fact,How to not worry on who follows me on insta and who doesn't etc.,"Understanding the impact of social media on self-esteem is crucial.

People may equate possessions like iPhones with relevance based on social media standards.

Stress is a very, very basic part of life. But because we do not deal with basic stressors, we try to accumulate and it becomes this huge. And it is just because we are unable to manage our perspective of the stress. It is usually the case uh what you can do, like, you know, if a particular person, like my first uh suggestion to deal with stress, to deal in coming out of stresses relaxing first, relaxing exercises. So there is this one particular technique called box breathing. So this is my go-to technique in which i ask the client to inhale. hold their breath for some time, exhale through the mouth and exhaling in such a manner that all the air comes out of the body and then hold the breath again. So we are making a box, we are inhaling, we are holding our breath, we are exhaling through the mouth and then we are holding our breath again. Then inhaling, holding, exhaling, holding, inhaling, holding, exhaling, holding. So a 15 minute of just this one activity has a tremendous effect on relaxing the mind. And when it comes to stress it is first we need to focus on the relaxation of the mind and then on the actual cause of the stress. If this technique suppose does not work and if the stress is way too much then I ask them to tighten their arm muscles and then release on the whole. Like the same system of the box breathing technique. But when they are holding, they actually have to tighten their muscles. Feel all the stress coming out, coming onto their muscles, the hand muscles. And then releasing upon the exhale so what is what happens over here is all the body's stress. Stress is felt in the body. Stress is not felt in the mind. stress is felt in the body. Okay, so once we start doing that, the body starts relieving releasing stress on a very very physical level. Once that starts to happen, that is when the body the mind starts calming itself, the mind starts thinking rationally and we can go ahead with the cause of the problem, cause of the stress. So yeah, these are two Very, very basic post-aid that i go ahead with and these have given tremendous effects, tremendous results. "

Now, when our subconscious mind is constantly working, if we have an anxious subconscious, then our subconscious mind is constantly bombarding itself with a lot of thoughts. and those thoughts, when they try to come on the surface level, like, they are so strong, they become so strong that they start imposing themselves on the conscious level also. And once that starts to happen, no matter how much tired you are, you will not be able to sleep. So, first, again, over here, it is very important that we first calm our subconscious. Again, meditation helps a lot, but before meditation also,understand what is the cause of those, you know, thoughts. The cause of all these anxious thoughts that are coming in. And for that, there are very different techniques. One of the techniques that i go ahead is that free flow technique. I ask the client to just start saying whatever is coming into their mind and they are and you know, close your eyes, relax a little bit. Just start saying whatever is coming to your mind. And they start narrating. And usually it is... They start going beyond. And that is where you come to know all the different areas which can cause trouble to the subconscious. The moment we tap into that, there's a list that we present. That, okay, these are the points I believe is causing a lot of trouble. And then we work on those points one by one. Even when we tackle one thing at a time, there is a lot of improvement in the sleep area. So, that is how we go ahead. Again, for the immediate benefit, you go for medications and everything, but medications will never penetrate beyond the surface. It only works on the surface. "
fact,Whenever I sit to study there is no mood then what to do?,"is like related to focus problems. Focus problems. Lovely question. So, okay. So, there is this one go-to technique that i usually suggest, which is pomodoro technique. I don't know whether i've spoken about pomodoro in the previous session or not, but Now, Pomodoro technique talks that you have to engage in 25 minutes of focused work and then 5 minutes of break. Okay. So, over there and you have to have a timer in front of you. So, that you can see, yes, this is how much time. This helps with a lot of overthinking also. And, you know, the moment you sit to study, you have to make up your mind, you know what, just 25 minutes. 25 minutes, I think, is achievable. if not 25 minutes, 20 minutes, okay. The gap of 20 to 25 we can manage. Okay, then, okay, 20 minutes of focused work, yeah, I don't think it should be that hard. And then you focus just on the work that you're doing. If some thought comes in, you should, you see the timer and be like, okay, you know what, 16 minutes are remaining. I will give importance to the thought also, but after 16 minutes. For the 16 minutes, now focus work, focus work, focus work. Okay. The moment your 16 minutes have passed, the whole 20 to 25 minutes, one Pomodoro segment has ended. Take a break. And take a break in such a manner that you are just getting up from that place where you sit to study. For five minutes, going out, getting refreshed, coming back again, timer, 20 to 25 minutes. if you do four segments also of 20 to 25 minutes this one, you are completing two hours of studies with a 20 minute break. So, that is a good enough thing and that helps a lot. If you actually go ahead with this technique, it helps a lot. Actually, I have been doing this technique indirectly. I didn't know I was actually because even I personally have focus problems, I can't concentrate on something for really long period of time. So what I do is I'll not exactly the time limit, more like page limit. That I'll cover these many pages, after that I'll take a break. Nice, nice. Good. Any limit should be set. That is the main goal. Yeah. "
fact,What are your thoughts on journaling in case of depression?,"Journaling, yes. Journaling is, you know, you start involving your own feelings also in journaling. It's a continuous process. but over here, it is a very systematic process because we are only focusing on one thought at a time. Okay, uh, if you, if just for two minutes, if i can draw and give you a, an understanding. Oh, great. I don't have the pen right now. And the pen i chose does not work. But, um, anyways, so it is basically like a tree branch. And we have to focus on that one particular thought when it comes to one tree branch. Suppose each of these fingers is a tree branch. So over here we will only write that one particular thought. Then over here we write the other particular thought. Then over here we write the other particular thought. Over here we write the other thought. There are so many instances where the client does not go beyond this. It is just these four thoughts that are revolving around again and again and again in the mind. And then we focus on each thought. And once the clarity is front of you, the thoughts are in front of you, you can actually focus on one thought at a time. You can choose among these thoughts which of the these thoughts require your attention most right now. And then we can choose a particular thought, we can work on that thought and then move to the next. yeah actually that was quite great explanation like the way you've explained about the branches yeah so okay I'll go on with the next one so what should I do to come out of stress I think it's already sort of covered but still if you want to add on something depression know there are people who underestimate depression so much and I think depression is a word that is used so much in common nowadays. People, now when it comes to the term clinical depression, you need to be in that state of lack of sleep, lack of motivation, lack of appetite, in some cases suicidal ideations, just a general sense of unhealthiness. So those things are certain things that are very very common Now usually we start with antidepressants at a much early rate because antidepressants help a lot in the mood stability. It is very important to get your mood stabilized first. If we do not go in the path of antidepressants, then we usually somehow encourage the client to go out and engage in some activity. be it any activity. Now even there, you know, we face a lot of challenge because the motivation is just not there. Even if I give them a task, suppose, clean your room, okay? This is a very, very simple task that I might give. But a person with depression will sit, will start, but then in the middle will just talk. It becomes very, very difficult for them to continue with the whole process. max to max, they can go and just fold their bed sheet but that's it. You know, they do not get motivated in doing something ahead. Then, if even that one particular activity is done, we need to provide so much reinforcement, so much positive, you know, affirmation, so much positivity in that one activity itself, that the person somehow gets motivated to do not one, but to other basic activities at the same time but then it requires a lot of constant counseling so usually again it depends on the severity of the depression the go-to part during the depression depression phase is first medication and then therapy but if any person decides not to go in for medication then we work on certain basic things that they can uh Overcome.  Simultaneously, we also focus on the low self-esteem part. So I usually start giving affirmations and in some cases it does not work very well in the start because the person has a very, very rigid sense of self. Okay, so we focus on the physical activity first holding uh you know, doing certain basic activities. at first and then going ahead with tapping into the cognitive part, which is the self-esteem part."
fact,How to relax myself when in stressful situation so that i dont regret the decisions i make in such situations later,"So, you know, your question requires so much pre-determined, pre-practiced approach. Because it is not just one time something happens and I am ready and I can deal with it. It does not happen like that. When the situation comes and you never know when the situation comes. Okay. So whenever the situation comes, our go to our body goes in a fight, flight, freeze response. Okay. so fight is the parasympathetic nervous system just activates itself. And we are in these three responses. So when we are in these three responses, our prefrontal lobe, which is responsible for decision making and problem solving, it shuts and our emotional brains take over because then emotional brain plus the our parasympathetic nervous system just takes over the body. Okay. So if you do not want that to take over in an instant, we need to start practicing on a very, very earlier stage. Okay, we need to start actually affirming ourselves. We need to start with breathing exercises, the ones that i shared with you. We need to start uh relieving stress on a very physical level. And yes, but again, it is not that one particular situation has occurred and I am, okay, you know what, it requires a lot of practice. It, I think, you know, the main focus would be how you are perceiving the situation, which again requires a lot of efforts. So yeah, it depends on how you are perceiving the situation. A failure can be sad for one person and devastating for the other. So you need to understand the difference. You need to understand the perspective with which the person is looking at it. When it is just sad, we can still manage. But when it is devastating, you are not in a position to manage it. So it requires a lot of pre-determined practices, pre-practiced practices, yeah, so that you are at that level where you can handle such Emotions. "
fact,"When I achieve something and I am happy about it, someone else tells me things where they tell things like others getting even better achievements than me and that makes me feel low about mine or feel jealous, how to motivate myself then","Are you talking about the comparison? Yeah. Okay. we motivate ourselves now when they go when comparison comes now we need to understand from where is it coming from. Is it coming from a good place uh a good place comparison would be uh you know, yes, I have achieved something. I am validating my achievement. But I also know that the other person has achieved much more. And I want to work towards it. Okay, I want to upgrade my own self. And I will work towards it. So, over here, the jealousy part doesn't come. It is just you are being focused on your own achievements and you want to go beyond it. Okay, that would be managing it in a healthy manner. Managing the comparison part in an unhandy manner will involve the feeling of jealousy, the feeling of envy, the feeling of he has achieved this, I will also do something like this. You basically try to follow that path. So over here you need to distinguish where is it coming from if the feeling of jealousy is involved then it is not coming from a very healthier place but if the feeling of yes i want to upgrade myself because i know there are people doing really great and i think i should also be on that level that is when you work you function from a very very healthier point of view and you function on your pace you there is you are not following anyone."
